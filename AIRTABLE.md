# Using Airtable

[Airtable](https://airtable.com/) is a cloud-based, flexible database with a spreadsheet-like interface that syncs changes across all your devices.

## Installation

No installation is necessary. Instead, sign up for Airtable [here](https://airtable.com/signup). The following steps will activate the free plan:
* After signing up, click continue until you get to the option to add a credit card
* Do not add your card details. Instead click on **skip**
* You will be taken to your workspace home screen. 

### Generating an API key

Once you are signed up for a free account with Airtable, navigate to [account overview](https://airtable.com/account). Under the secton **<>API** click '_Generate API key_'. To reveal the key, click within the textbox.

## Features

A **base** is a Airtable's term for a database. Within a base you can create one or more tables. Most of your work will revolve around bases. 

A **table** is like one page of your standard spreadsheet, with some additional features, including the ability to drag and drop attachments, and linking records in one table to records in another.

Within a table, each column is called a **field**, and a row is called a **record**.  

A video walkthrough of all the features is available [here] (https://vimeo.com/165624533/472b9dcc9c).
